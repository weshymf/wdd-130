                <h2>BALDUR'S GATE 3</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="Metacritic">
                <p><strong>Metacritic Score:</strong> 96</p>

            </div>
            <div class="Review">
                <p><strong>Plot:</strong></p>
                Baldur's Gate 3 takes place in the fictional world of the Forgotten Realms during the year of 1492 DR,
                over 120 years after the events of the previous game, Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn, and months after the events of
                the playable Dungeons & Dragons 5e module, Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus.
                The story is set primarily in the Sword Coast in western Faerûn, encompassing a forested area that includes the Emerald Grove,
                a druid grove dedicated to the deity Silvanus; Moonrise Towers and the Shadow-Cursed Lands,
                which are covered by an unnatural and sentient darkness that can only be penetrated through magical means;
                and Baldur's Gate, the largest and most affluent city in the region, as well as its outlying suburb of Rivington.
                Other places the player will pass through include the Underdark, the Astral Plane and Avernus.
                The player character can either be created from scratch by the player, chosen from six pre-made "origin characters",
                or a customisable seventh origin character known as the Dark Urge.
                All six pre-made origin characters can be recruited as part of the player character's party.
                <p></p>
                The protagonist wakes up inside a giant dimension-crossing illithid (mind flayer) flying ship.
                They are implanted with an illithid tadpole, a parasite that enthrals and transforms people into illithids; however, the transformation does not happen,
                and the ship comes under attack from githyanki warriors.
                The protagonist is freed during the fighting and steers the damaged ship to Faerûn, where it crashes.
                They encounter other survivors of the wreck, all likewise implanted with tadpoles.
                The party seeks to remove their parasites through numerous avenues, all of which fail to provide a cure.
                They are saved from the tadpoles' overwhelming psychic force by a "Dream Visitor" inside Shadowheart's mysterious prism,
                a device that is sought after by the githyanki. The protagonist then becomes involved in the fate of the Emerald Grove,
                where local druids and tiefling refugees face off against the goblin horde from the desecrated Selûnite temple nearby.
                Once the party either sacks or saves the grove, they travel through the mountains or the Underdark to reach Moonrise Towers in search of a new cure.
                <p></p>
                <p><strong>Final considerations:</strong></p>
                I don't want to say every CRPG going forward should aspire to be like Baldur's Gate 3.
                Not everything needs to be nearly this big and ambitious, or even this dense.
                But it is a landmark moment in the genre, and if I had to point to one paragon that I would like everyone else making these to take inspiration from,
                this is absolutely it. We waited 14 years for the stars to align again so that we could get the ideal mix of crunchy, tactical, old-school RPG combat,
                an epic and well-written story with complex characters and lots of meaningful choices,
                and a level of polish and cinematic presentation that let me see the sweat and the sorrow on characters' faces in their darkest hours.
                Plenty of other games have partially completed that list, but the last time they all came together was Dragon Age: Origins in 2009.
                And I can finally say that game, and its Infinity Engine predecessors, have a worthy successor that's not just matched their RPG greatness, but surpassed it.
                Baldur's Gate 3 is just about everything I could have asked for.

                <h2>THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: TEARS OF THE KINGDOM</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="Metacritic">
                <p><strong>Metacritic Score:</strong> 96</p>

            </div>
            <div class="Review">
                <p><strong>Plot:</strong></p>
                Tears of the Kingdom takes place a number of years after Breath of the Wild, at the end of the Zelda timeline in the kingdom of Hyrule.
                Link and Zelda set out to explore a cavern beneath Hyrule Castle, from which gloom, a poisonous substance, has been seeping out and causing people to fall ill.
                There, they find a mural depicting the founding of Hyrule and a subsequent conflict known as
                the Imprisoning War—an ancient battle against a being only referred to as the "Demon King"—and decide to venture deeper, triggering the
                awakening of a mummy who attacks the two with gloom. Link's right arm is badly damaged, the Master Sword is shattered, and Hyrule Castle is raised upwards by the mummy.
                Zelda falls below, and as Link tries to catch her, she vanishes with a mysterious artifact.
                Link is rescued by a disembodied arm, which had been restraining the mummy, and on the Great Sky Island, he awakens to find that it has replaced his damaged arm.
                He meets the spirit of Rauru, a Zonai, and the source of Link's new arm.
                Rauru assists Link as he traverses the Great Sky Island, and when the latter reaches his destination, the shattered Master Sword vanishes, and Link dives to the surface below.
                <p></p>
                <p><strong>Final considerations:</strong></p>
                The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is an unfathomable follow-up to one of the greatest games ever made,
                somehow improving upon it in nearly every way – be that with simple quality-of-life improvements,
                a genuinely exciting story, or wildly creative new building mechanics that make you rethink what is possible.
                It both revamps old ground and introduces vast new areas so immense it somehow makes me wonder if Breath of the Wild was actually all that big,
                with an almost alarming number of tasks to complete, mysteries to discover,
                and delightful distractions to keep you from ever reaching that place you naively thought you were headed.
                Nintendo has followed up a triumph with a triumph, expanding and evolving a world that already felt full beyond expectation and raising the bar ever higher into the clouds.

                Peter starts his first day as a physics teacher with Miles among his students, but they are interrupted by an attack by Sandman, requiring both of them to subdue him.
                Fired for abandoning the class, Peter returns to his Aunt May's home in Queens, which he has moved into following her death, to meet with his girlfriend Mary Jane.
                They are surprised to see their old friend Harry, who has miraculously recovered from his terminal illness.
                Harry hires Peter to work at his new startup, the Emily-May Foundation (EMF), so they can "heal the world".
                Concurrently, Miles struggles to write his college application essay and learns that his mother Rio has begun dating.
                <p></p>
                While overseeing a prisoner transfer, Peter and Miles fail to stop Kraven and his forces from capturing Scorpion and Li.
                While investigating Kraven, Peter discovers he is capturing super-powered individuals to hunt them for sport.
                Having already killed Scorpion, Vulture, Shocker, and Electro, Kraven attempts to capture Hardy; however, Miles helps her escape to Paris.
                While visiting Coney Island to reconnect, Peter, Mary Jane, and Harry witness Kraven's hunters attack the park to capture Tombstone.
                While Peter rescues civilians caught in the crossfire, he is assisted by an empowered Harry,
                who learns about Peter's double life and reveals that he was cured by Curt Connors via an organic exosuit that physically augments his body.
                With his powers rapidly developing, Harry helps Peter rescue Tombstone while Mary Jane discovers that Kraven has kidnapped Connors.
                The trio attempt to save Connors, but Kraven forcibly turns him back into the Lizard.
                Connors escapes while Kraven mortally wounds Peter, who is saved when Harry's exosuit transfers itself to Peter's body.
                After Peter confronts Kraven with his newly enhanced powers, Kraven develops an interest in hunting Peter personally.

                <p><strong>Final considerations:</strong></p>
                As a sequel in a spectacular series, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is both blessed and cursed.
                Its story of two Spider-Men is a great time and a Spidey fan's dream to play through as comic book pages are brought to life,
                elegantly walking the tightrope between light humour and heavier themes.
                Meanwhile, Insomniac refines a successful formula of combat and web-swinging without revolutionising either in major ways,
                making them comfy and familiar with just enough new tweaks and abilities to elevate them to fun new heights.
                The part that feels like it actually needed a radical rethinking is the open world of New York City,
                which has been made bigger but not better, with an exhausting checklist of mostly repetitious side activities.
                But it's safe to call this another thrilling Spider-Man adventure that delivers Insomniac's best tale yet, and despite its open world falling short,
                it's a reliably fun superhero power trip. And, you know what? Screw it. It really did make me feel like Spider-Man, too.

                <h2>CYBERPUNK 2077 (2.0 VERSION + PHANTOM LIBERTY DLC)</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="Metacritic">
                <p><strong>Metacritic Score:</strong> 89</p>

            <div class="Review">
                <p><strong>Plot:</strong></p>
                Cyberpunk 2077 is an action role-playing game played from a first-person perspective as V, a mercenary whose voice, face, hairstyle, body type and modifications,
                background, and clothing are customisable. Stat categories—Body, Intelligence, Reflexes, Technical, and Cool—influence player's gameplay style.
                The three primary play styles are Netrunner (hacking), Techie (machinery), and Solo (combat).
                V must consult a "ripperdoc" to upgrade and purchase cyberware implants.
                The rarity of any given equipment is shown by a coloured tier system. V can take cover, aim, run, jump, double jump, and slide.
                Melee strikes can be dealt with close-combat weapons. There are three types of ranged weapons, all of which can be customised and modified—Power (standard),
                Tech (which penetrates walls and enemies), and Smart (with homing bullets).
                Ranged weapons are equipped to ricochet bullets in a target's direction and slow them down in bullet time.
                Four types of damage can be inflicted and resisted—Physical, Thermal, Electric, and Chemical.
                 Weapon use increases accuracy and reloading speed, which are manifested in character animations.
                 The game can be completed without killing anyone, with non-lethal options for weapons and cyberware.
                 <p></p>
                 The open world metropolis of Night City consists of six regions; the corporate City Centre, immigrant-inhabited Watson, luxurious Westbrook,
                 suburban Heywood, gang-infested Pacifica, and industrial Santo Domingo. Its surrounding area, the Badlands, can also be explored.
                 V navigates these locations on foot and in vehicles, which are subject to either a third- or first-person view.
                 Pedestrians are vulnerable to vehicular collisions. Depending on the location, law enforcement may be alerted if V commits a crime.
                 Radio stations are available to listen to. The full day-night cycle and dynamic weather affect the way non-player characters (NPCs) behave.
                 V owns an apartment and a garage. Night City features non-English-speaking characters, whose languages can be translated with special implants.
                 "Braindance" is a device that allows V to undergo other people's experiences. Branching dialogues enable interaction with NPCs and actions in quests.
                 Experience points are obtained from main quests and fuel the stats; side quests yield "street cred", unlocking skills, vendors, places, and additional quests.
                 Quests are acquired from characters known as Fixers. Throughout the game, V is aided by various companions.
                 Consumables, like soft drinks, are used for healing, and objects can be inspected in V's inventory.
                 Minigames include hacking, boxing, auto racing, martial arts, and shooting ranges. The player's in-game choices can lead to different endings.
                <p></p>
                <p><strong>Final considerations:</strong></p>
                CD Projekt Red now has a blueprint for where to go with Cyberpunk 2077, and Phantom Liberty shows the studio already had exactly that in mind.
                Between a more sophisticated level of storytelling with excellent performances, smarter insights on the cyberpunk genre and its dystopian themes,
                and landing on top of a much-improved gameplay experience thanks to its fresh 2.0 update,
                Phantom Liberty marks a new chapter for Cyberpunk 2077 and is finally close to what we'd hoped it would be when we first sat down to play three years ago with the first game.

                <p><strong>Plot:</strong></p>
                Twenty years after the Colony War, the United Colonies and Freestar Collective enjoy an uneasy peace.
                The player assumes the role of a space miner working for the company Argos Extractors, who have been commissioned
                by the enigmatic Constellation–a famed group of galactic explorers–to locate an Artifact with strange gravitational effects buried underground.
                After extracting the Artifact, the player character experiences a vision propelling them through time and space.
                They awake to learn that their client is en route to collect the Artifact.
                Shortly after meeting the client and defending the mining operation from a Crimson Fleet attack, the player travels to New Atlantis, the capital of the United Colonies,
                to deliver the Artifact to Constellation's Lodge. From there, the player joins Constellation in their quest to locate more of the Artifacts,
                believing them to be one of the greatest mysteries left for humanity to uncover.
                Over the course of their journey, the player has the opportunity to join various factions throughout the Settled Systems, including among others the UC Vanguard,
                a volunteer force dedicated to protecting United Colonies space, and the Freestar Rangers, who defend the people of the Freestar Collective above all else.

                After meeting the remaining members of Constellation and collecting several more Artifacts, the player is directed to investigate an anomaly that corresponds
                with the presence of an Artifact, but is significantly stronger.
                There, they uncover an ancient temple and activate it, which gives the player the ability to use certain powers.
                The player then joins Constellation's benefactor and fellow member Walter Stroud in his efforts to obtain an Artifact from the pleasure city of Neon.
                After retrieving the Artifact, they are accosted by an unknown and unrecognizable entity calling itself "Starborn".
                The Starborn demands the Artifact, but Constellation are able to escape.
                <p></p>
                Constellation's mission to collect the Artifacts continues, spurred on by the competition they now face from the Starborn.
                In an effort to increase their scanning range to locate more Artifacts, the player is directed to help fix The Eye, Constellation's satellite in orbit.
                During this mission, the player receives word that Constellation's Lodge is under attack from the Starborn. The player can choose between defending The Eye or the Lodge.
                Depending on which location the player travels to, one of Constellation's members dies in the attacks.
                Constellation escapes with the Artifacts, much to the surprise of the attacking Starborn "Hunter". The Hunter allows the player to leave, promising that they will meet again.

                <p><strong>Final considerations:</strong></p>
                It's never a great sign when someone recommends a game on the grounds that it gets good after more than a dozen hours,
                but that's very much the kind of game Starfield is, and I do recommend it.
                There are a lot of forces working against it, and the combination of disjointed space travel, nonexistent maps, aggravating inventory management,
                and a slow rollout of essential abilities very nearly did it in.
                It was the joys piloting a custom spaceship into and out of all sorts of morally ambiguous situations in a rich sci-fi universe that eventually pulled it out of a nosedive.
                I'm glad that I powered through the early hours, because its interstellar mystery story pays off and, once the ball got rolling,
                combat on foot and in space gradually became good enough that its momentum carried me into New Game+ after I'd finished the main story after around 60 hours.
                Like Skryim and Fallout 4 before it, there's still an immense amount of quality roleplaying quests and interesting NPCs out there, waiting to be stumbled across,
                and the pull to seek it out is strong.
