            <div class="Metacritic">

                <p><strong>Plot:</strong></p>
                Early in their journey to repair the Elden Ring, the player-character Tarnished encounters a maiden named Melina.
                Because the Tarnished is maidenless, Melina offers to act as their maiden, granting them the ability to turn runes into strength
                and giving the Tarnished a steed named Torrent. In exchange, Melina requires the Tarnished to take her to the Erdtree, the home of the Elden Ring.
                Melina later takes the Tarnished to the Roundtable Hold, a gathering place for other Tarnished seeking to repair the Elden Ring.
                The Hold's benefactor the Two Fingers instructs the Tarnished to collect the Great Runes and bring them to the Erdtree, where they can be used to repair the Elden Ring.
                <p></p>
                The Tarnished travels into the Lands Between, investigating its locales and defeating the demigods.
                After recovering at least two Great Runes, the Two Fingers allows them to battle Morgott the Grace-Given, the demigod guarding the Erdtree.
                The Tarnished defeats Morgott but finds a wall of thorns blocking the Erdtree's interior.
                Melina arrives and advises the Tarnished to find the Flame of Ruin, which they can use to ignite the Erdtree and destroy the thorns.
                The Tarnished is free to travel towards the Flame of Ruin or search for a way to harness the equally powerful Frenzied Flame.
                <p></p>
                If upon obtaining the Flame of Ruin the Tarnished did not gain the power of the Frenzied Flame, Melina takes the Flame of Ruin and sacrifices herself to set alight the Erdtree.
                If the Tarnished gained the power of the Frenzied Flame, Melina abandons the Tarnished, forcing them to use the Frenzied Flame to set alight the Erdtree.
                While the Erdtree burns, the Tarnished is transported to the ruined city Farum Azula.
                After defeating Maliketh the Black Blade and using his Rune of Death to fuel the fire, the Tarnished is returned to the foot of the scorched Erdtree.
                Inside, they fight Radagon, Queen Marika's consort possessing her body, and the tree's guardian the Elden Beast.
                After both are vanquished, the Tarnished gains access to Marika's shattered corpse, which contains the remains of the Elden Ring.
                Depending on the Tarnished's actions during the game, six different endings can be achieved; these include the Tarnished becoming the Elden Lord,
                the Elden Ring being destroyed by Ranni the Witch, and the Tarnished using the Frenzied Flame to destroy the Lands Between.
                <p></p>
                <p><strong>Final considerations:</strong></p>
                It is no exaggeration to say that Elden Ring is FromSoftware's largest and most ambitious game yet, and that ambition has more than paid off.
                Even after 87 hours of blood, sweat, and tears that included some of the most challenging fights I've ever fought, and innumerable surprises,
                there are still bosses that I left on the table, secrets that I've yet to uncover, sidequests that I missed out on, tons of weapons, spells,
                and skills that I've never used. And this is all on top of PVP and cooperative play that I've barely been able to scratch the surface of.
                Throughout it all, while the fundamentals of combat haven't changed much from what we've seen before,
                the enormous variety of viciously designed enemies and the brutal but surmountable bosses have brought its battles to a new level.
                Even with all the threads I didn't manage to tug on my first playthrough (of what I'm sure will be several),
                what I was treated to can easily be held amongst the best open-world games I've ever played.
                Like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild before it, Elden Ring is one that we'll be looking back on as a game that moved a genre forward.

                <p><strong>Plot:</strong></p>
                Near the end of Fimbulwinter, Kratos and Atreus return home—fending off an ambush from a vengeful Freya—to find their wolf Fenrir in his final moments.
                Atreus' grief transforms him into a bear through his still-uncontrolled Giant and godly magic, briefly battling Kratos before returning to his senses.
                As prophesied in Atreus' dream three winters ago, Thor arrives with Odin, who proposes leaving them alone if Atreus abandons his secret search for Týr.
                Kratos refuses and duels Thor to a stalemate, and Odin tells Atreus he will leave Kratos alone if the former comes to Asgard.
                Kratos, Atreus, and Mímir take refuge at Sindri's home on a branch of Yggdrasil in the center of the nine realms.
                <p></p>
                Atreus admits he and Sindri have been searching for clues about Týr's whereabouts.
                Though angered at Atreus' secrecy, Kratos reluctantly agrees to help him and they rescue a pacifistic Týr in Svartalfheim.
                The group head to Gróa's shrine in Alfheim to understand the prophecy concerning Ragnarök and learn Gróa lied:
                only Asgard is fated to be destroyed while all other realms survive under a new champion, implied to be Atreus under the name Loki.
                <p></p>
                <p><strong>Final considerations:</strong></p>
                An enthralling spectacle to behold and an even more exciting one to take the reins of, God of War Ragnarok melds action and adventure together to create a new,
                unforgettable Norse saga. Impeccable writing, pitch-perfect performances, knockout action – it's a complete work of art from top to bottom.
                Reflecting its core themes, it's everything a sequel should be: respectful of its legendary lineage, but not afraid to take it to exciting new places.
                God of War Ragnarok is an almighty achievement and creates a new high that makes many of its peers look positively mortal by comparison.

                <p><strong>Plot:</strong></p>
                In the six months following the defeat of HADES (Anthony Ingruber) in Horizon Zero Dawn,
                Aloy has been searching fruitlessly for a working backup of GAIA (Lesley Ewen) to restore the planet's rapidly degrading biosphere.
                After she discovers that her former associate Sylens (Lance Reddick) did not destroy but stole HADES,
                he contacts Aloy and asks her to continue her search in the region known as the Forbidden West.
                <p></p>
                Aloy and her friend Varl (John Macmillan) cross into the west to find the ruling Tenakth tribe amidst a
                civil war between Chief Hekarro (Geno Segers) and the rebel leader Regalla (Angela Bassett).
                Aloy tracks Sylens to a facility where she finds HADES badly damaged and permanently deletes it.
                She recovers a GAIA backup without its subsystems but is interrupted by a group of futuristic humans.
                The group, consisting of their leader Gerard (Dan Donohue), his lieutenant Tilda (Carrie-Anne Moss), enforcer Erik (Marc Kudisch),
                and accompanied by a clone of Sobeck named Beta (also voiced by Burch), possess advanced technology that renders them invulnerable.
                They take a second GAIA backup while Aloy barely escapes.
                <p></p>
                Zo (Erica Luttrell), a member of the nearby Utaru tribe, guides Aloy to a control center where she rejoins GAIA with her subsystem MINERVA.
                GAIA locates the other subsystems, AETHER, DEMETER, and POSEIDON, and advises Aloy to retrieve them before attempting to capture the more advanced HEPHAESTUS.
                GAIA reveals the extinction signal that triggered HADES and mutated the subsystems originated from the Sirius system; Aloy suspects that the futuristic humans sent it.
                She later tracks down Beta, who informs Aloy that her group are, in fact, Far Zenith,
                an organization of billionaire colonists who fled Earth during its global extinction, having managed to extend their natural lifespans.
                After their colony on Sirius collapsed, the Zeniths returned to Earth to use GAIA through Beta's genetic make-up for their own recolonization.
                They already acquired subsystems ELEUTHIA, ARTEMIS, and APOLLO, but Beta has stolen their GAIA backup.
                <p></p>
                Aloy and her companions assault Far Zenith's base, while Beta releases HEPHAESTUS into the Zeniths' network and it builds
                a near-endless amount of machines that tie down Far Zenith's army of drones. Sylens disables the Zeniths' personal defences, allowing Aloy and Zo to kill Erik,
                while Tilda kills Gerard. Aloy and Beta learn that the Far Zenith colony was destroyed by Nemesis, a failed mind uploading experiment they created;
                the Zeniths fled from Nemesis and hoped to steal GAIA to colonize a new planet.
                Nemesis also sent the extinction signal to Earth and is en route to destroy the planet.
                Tilda tries to force Aloy to abandon Earth with her, but Aloy refuses and is forced to kill Tilda.
                Sylens reveals that HADES told him about Nemesis and also plans to escape Earth, but has a change of heart and decides to aid Aloy against Nemesis.
                Aloy's companions disperse to spread the warning of Nemesis while Aloy and Beta reactivate GAIA.
                <p></p>
                <p><strong>Final considerations:</strong></p>
                A triumphant combination of enthralling combat, top-tier creature and character design, and a captivating open world,
                Horizon Forbidden West is an absolute blast and fantastic showcase for the power of the PS5.
                Although the return of a couple of familiar series trappings and a noticeable lack of freeform climbing never threatens to derail the enjoyment,
                it does leave it falling frustratingly short of something revolutionary.
                Major evolutionary steps have firmly been placed in the right direction, however, and there's no doubting the many,
                many hours of fun to have with Aloy, who stakes her claim further to be one of this generation of gaming's greatest characters.
                Guerrilla has outdone itself yet again with Forbidden West, and at this trajectory, neither the horizon nor the sky's the limit for what could come next.

                <h2>GRAN TURISMO 7</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="Metacritic">
                <p><strong>Metacritic Score:</strong> 87</p>
                <p><strong>User Score:</strong> 2.3</p>
            </div>
            <div class="Review">
                <p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>
                Gran Turismo 7 features the return of the single player campaign, GT Simulation Mode.
                Other returning features are the return of traditional racing tracks and vehicles, Special Events, Championships, Driving School, Tuning Parts Shop,
                Used Cars dealership, and GT Auto while still retaining the new GT Sport Mode, Brand Central, and Discover (now labelled Showcase) that were introduced in Gran Turismo Sport.
                The player needs to progress through tasks ("Menu Books") from the GT Café to unlock features like multiplayer, and all tracks and cars.
                <p></p>
                The game features the return of dynamic time and weather effects, which previously appeared in Gran Turismo 5 and Gran Turismo 6.
                Despite the game including a single player campaign, like with Gran Turismo Sport, the game requires a constant internet connection
                in order for players to be able to save their progress.
                The series creator Kazunori Yamauchi explains that this decision was made to prevent hacking and cheating. Arcade mode is fully playable offline.
                <p></p>
                For the PlayStation 5 version, the game takes advantage of the console's increased processing power, dedicated ray-tracing hardware,
                custom solid-state drive storage, Tempest Engine, and DualSense controller to support features such as advanced haptic technology feedback,
                adaptive triggers, real-time ray tracing effects, 3D spatial audio, and reduced loading times.
                The PlayStation 5 version of Gran Turismo 7 also runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second with support for high dynamic range.
                In addition, drivers from Gran Turismo's esports competition, the Gran Turismo World Series
                (previously the FIA-Certified Gran Turismo Championships utilizing Gran Turismo Sport), appear as AI opponents and License Test coaches.
                <p></p>
                <p><strong>Final considerations:</strong></p>
                On the eve of the series' 25th birthday, Gran Turismo 7 is more than just a celebration of cars this time around; in some ways, it's also a celebration of itself.
                A modern mix of the original Gran Turismo's trendsetting format with GT Sport's stern but very successful focus on competitive online racing,
                this version is a potent podium performance from developer Polyphony Digital. With gorgeous graphics, a fantastic driving feel, and racing options galore,
                it's the best the series has been since its dominant PlayStation 2 era.
                It does have some significant failings, though, including how it continues to cripple its career mode races with dreadfully flawed rolling starts,
                its car list is no longer as comprehensive as the competition, and its always-online single-player mode still seems needlessly punitive.
                But all of that is on the periphery of GT7's outstanding driving experiences,
                which are enhanced by the PS5's gorgeous graphics and intense and flavourful haptic feedback via the DualSense controller.

                Unwilling to see Hugo locked up as the Order's test subject, Amicia takes Hugo and leaves Beatrice and Lucas to seek an island of which Hugo has recurring dreams,
                hoping it will lead to a cure for the Macula. Along the way, they are pursued by Provence soldiers, as well as mercenaries led by the disgraced knight Arnaud (Harry Myers).
                Arnaud offers to arrange transport to the island from Hugo's dreams, La Cuna. They sail to the island on the ship of Arnaud's smuggler friend Sophia (Anna Demetriou).
                <p></p>
                Arriving at La Cuna, the group discovers that the residents, led by Count Victor (Alistair Petrie) and Countess Emilie (Ellie Heydon),
                worship a pagan deity called the Child of Embers.
                Arnaud tries to coerce Hugo into summoning rats to attack Victor — whom he blames for the death of his son — but Amicia intervenes, and Arnaud is arrested.
                Amicia deduces that the Count and Countess are unknowingly worshipping a previous Macula carrier as the Child.
                With Sophia, they delve into an ancient Order temple, following the history of the carrier, Basilius, and his protector, Aelia.
                Entering a chapel where Aelia was imprisoned after rebelling against the Order, the group encounters a cult of slavers who offer human sacrifices to the Child;
                Hugo summons rats to kill the slavers. The group discovers Basilius was imprisoned underground by the Order to contain the Macula, and Aelia died before she could reach him.
                Without Aelia, Basilius gave in to the Macula and unleashed the Justinian Plague.
                Amicia realizes the Macula showed Hugo the dream to lure him into its clutches, and they flee the prison as it collapses under a horde of rats.
                <p></p>
                Amicia and Hugo return to Victor's castle and reunite with Beatrice and Lucas. Amicia reasons that, if they are there to support Hugo, the Macula will remain dormant.
                However, Victor reveals Emilie believes Hugo is the Child — a myth Victor invented for Emilie, who is infertile — so they must kill Hugo's old family and adopt him.
                After Emilie kills Beatrice in a ritual sacrifice, Hugo summons a horde of rats which devours Emilie and destroys much of the island.
                Amicia's group rescues Arnaud before escaping on Sophia's ship, with Victor in pursuit.
                Victor wounds Amicia and captures Hugo while the rest are forced overboard.
                On shore, Arnaud sacrifices himself to allow Amicia to kill Victor, but they are too late to prevent Hugo, who believes Amicia to be dead,
                from giving himself over to the Macula. A cloud blots out the sun, allowing the rats to spread unchecked and destroy Marseille.
                Amicia and Lucas enter the ruined city and sink into a phantasmic reality created by the Macula.
                Here, Hugo's voice tells Amicia that, having now fully merged with the Macula, the only way to stop the rats is to kill him.
                Hugo is killed by Lucas if Amicia refuses to do so.
                <p></p>
                One year later, Amicia has a home in the mountains, and Lucas is continuing his alchemy studies elsewhere.
                Amicia prepares to journey with Sophia to find the next Macula carrier and protector so that she can help guide them.
                Before she leaves, she pays her respects to Hugo's grave.
                In a post-credits scene set in the modern era, a child is on a ventilator, with signs of the Macula on its skin.

                <p><strong>Final considerations:</strong></p>
                A Plague Tale: Requiem is an impressive sequel to one of my favorite action-adventure games, upping the ante in almost every way.
                It doesn't do a ton to distinguish itself from its predecessor in terms of its actual gameplay mechanics, but with a depressing yet awesome story,
                fantastic graphics, and rat-filled moments that I'll never forget, this unique adventure very much deserves your attention.
                I certainly wish it were more ambitious with its stealth action sandbox and took more risks than it does,
                but it's still a worthy follow-up that left me with some great memories and a few recurring nightmares.
