            <div class="Metacritic">
                <p><strong>Metacritic Score:</strong> 92</p>

                <p></p>
                Forza Horizon 5 is a racing video game set in an open world environment based in a fictional representation of Mexico.
                The game has the largest map in the entire Forza Horizon series, being 50% larger than its predecessor,
                Forza Horizon 4, while also having the highest point in the Horizon series.
                The map was described by creative director Mike Brown as one of the most diverse Forza Horizon maps the team has built.
                The map contains an active caldera volcano, jungles and beaches, ancient Mayan temples, and towns and cities such as Guanajuato.
                Players can explore the open world freely, though they can also compete in multiplayer races and complete the campaign mode.
                Both the cars featured in the game and the player character can be extensively customised.
                Players are able to create custom liveries and tunes for cars, and perform engine swaps, drivetrain swaps, or install body kits on certain vehicles.
                The game is the first in the franchise to support ray tracing on cars (although this is only available in Forzavista).
                <p></p>
                The game introduces a new weather system (local weather) in which players can visit one side of the map and can visibly see a storm.
                Because Mexico is such a vast nation with such a wide range of elevations, multiple climates would appear in the game at around the same time.
                The four seasons still exist but would affect the eleven unique biomes around the map.
                For example, in the dry season, dust storms will appear, while tropical storms occur throughout the fall storm season.
                Another detail is in the jungle, in which the environment would now react to the weather; an example of this is leaves flying everywhere.
                <p></p>
                <p><strong>Final considerations:</strong></p>
                Forza Horizon 5 is a deep and nuanced car nirvana for revheads and auto geeks to endlessly collect, tinker, and experiment.
                It's also an extremely accessible buffet of racing spectacle open to everyone,
                from Deluxe Edition diehards to Game Pass nomads – no matter their driving skill or mechanical knowledge.
                It's an occasionally goofy but always earnest Valentine to Mexico's world-famous culture,
                and a romantic ode to the magic of road-tripping through postcard-perfect vacation vistas.
                It's a long haul, MMO-inspired racer that's exploding with more races, activities,
                and event types than can comfortably fit on some parts of the map – and yet it still always feels relaxed rather than daunting.
                It never locks you into something you don't want to do and steadily rewards you for however you choose to play it.
                It looks beautiful, it sounds magnificent, and it is glorious to play. Yes, Forza Horizon 5 is a lot of things.
                Above all, however, it is the result of a racing studio at the peak of its craft and the best open-world racing game I've ever played.

                <p></p>
                Cody (Joseph Balderrama) and May (Annabelle Dowler), a married couple, are planning on getting a divorce.
                After they tell their daughter Rose (Clare Corbett) the news, she takes her hand-made dolls, which look like her parents,
                into the family shed and tries to repair their relationship by play-acting.
                The parents find themselves trapped inside the dolls' bodies as a consequence of Rose's tears landing on the dolls.
                Dr. Hakim, who has assumed the anthropomorphic form of his relationship therapy book,
                tells May and Cody that he has been given the job of trying to fix their relationship as they try to reach Rose.
                <p></p>
                At first, Cody and May are more focused on trying to reach Rose, who they hope knows of a way to return them to their human bodies.
                However, Hakim continually interferes with their progress, often putting obstacles and tests in their way to force them to collaborate to progress.
                They also come across anthropomorphic versions of their old possessions, who criticize Cody and May for their mistreatment and negligence of both their possessions and Rose.
                As they travel all around their property, Cody and May are reminded of the positive memories they had together,
                as well as what originally drew them together to become a couple, and learn to work together and collaborate to move forward in their journey.
                <p></p>
                In a final series of obstacles, Hakim encourages Cody and May to rediscover their passions and support each other.
                This first takes them on an adventure through Cody's overgrown, abandoned garden and greenhouse, which May helps him to restore.
                They then work together to help May rediscover her passion for music and singing.
                Meanwhile, Rose continues to do her best to mend the relationship between her parents,
                but both Cody and May's real bodies have fallen unconscious and will not respond to her.
                Thinking her parents are ignoring her, Rose comes to believe that she is the reason their marriage
                is falling apart and decides to run away in hopes that will make them stay together.
                <p></p>
                After a long journey, Cody and May finally complete Hakim's final test, gathering an orchestra and audience for May to perform in front of.
                As May sings, the relationship between her and Cody is at last fully healed, and they kiss, which reverses the trance they are in.
                They reawaken in their real bodies and are shocked to learn that Rose has already run away.
                Fortunately, they are able to find her at a nearby bus stop and assure her that she is not the cause of their arguments and that they will always love her no matter what happens. The trio then return home with a new perspective on their relationship.
                <p></p>
                <p><strong>Final considerations:</strong></p>
                It Takes Two is a spectacular co-op adventure that lays down a path of great gameplay ideas and uses it to play a giddy game of hopscotch.
                It's beautiful, breakneck-paced, and bubbling over with creativity, and playfulness and experimentation are rewarded at every turn.
                If you have any kind of co-op partner in your life, be they spouse, friend, sibling, or other (even a child, though the themes might be too mature for them),
                It Takes Two is a truly joyful trip you really need to take together.

                <h2>HITMAN 3</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="Metacritic">
                <p><strong>Metacritic Score:</strong> 87</p>
                <p><strong>User Score:</strong> 7.6</p>
            </div>
            <div class="Review">
                <p><strong>Plot:</strong></p>
                During the events of Hitman 2, Agent 47 and his handler, Diana Burnwood, defect from the International Contract Agency (ICA)
                and join forces with rogue mercenary Lucas Grey to track down Providence, a secretive alliance of corporate executives, politicians,
                and industrialists collectively wielding political, military, and economic influence.
                In the game's final mission, the trio kidnap Arthur Edwards, Providence's intermediary known as the Constant,
                who identifies the three Partners controlling Providence: Carl Ingram, Marcus Stuyvesant, and Alexa Carlisle.
                Edwards, however, later escapes captivity and seized the Partners' corporate assets for himself.
                In Hitman 3, 47 and Grey seek revenge on Providence for turning them both into assassins through childhood conditioning and genetic experimentation,
                while Diana is motivated by the death of her parents—unaware that 47 carried out the killings while under Providence's control.
                <p></p>
                Working together, 47 and Grey eliminate Ingram and Stuyvesant in Dubai during the inauguration of the Scepter
                (modeled after the Burj Khalifa), the world's tallest skyscraper, and Carlisle at her ancestral manor in Dartmoor.
                Following the Partners' deaths, Edwards assumes control of Providence and deploys mercenaries, who capture Grey and Diana.
                47 arranges to meet hacker Olivia Hall, Grey's only other trusted ally, in Berlin.
                Discovering that the ICA is tailing them, 47 kills several ICA agents sent to eliminate him,
                before he and Hall decide to conclusively stop the ICA by exposing its crimes to the public.
                47 eliminates Hush and Imogen Royce, the overseers of the ICA's data storage facility in Chongqing,
                allowing Hall to steal and publish all of the ICA's operational data, while deleting all records referencing 47 and Diana.
                The ICA is irrevocably compromised and dismantled, ending 47's career as a professional assassin.
                <p></p>
                Meanwhile, Edwards attempts to convert Diana to succeed him as Constant and seeks her betrayal of 47 by revealing that he killed her parents.
                Diana seemingly double-deals both sides, accepting Edwards's offer while inviting 47 to a gathering of
                Providence members in Mendoza, where he is instructed to eliminate the only people opposed to Diana's succession—Tamara Vidal and
                Don Archibald Yates—so that she can dismantle the organization upon assuming control.
                After he follows her instructions, 47's longtime trust in Diana is shaken when she incapacitates him with poison, seemingly as revenge for the murder of her parents.
                <p></p>
                In a dream, a vision of Grey persuades 47 that Diana has not betrayed him, but rather helped to put Edwards within his reach.
                47 wakes up imprisoned on a Providence-controlled train travelling in Romania through the Carpathian Mountains.
                47 learns that Edwards is on board the train. When 47 confronts Edwards, he reveals that he had intended to once more turn
                47 into a Providence assassin by wiping his memory through an injection of serum.
                Edwards leaves 47 with a choice: kill Edwards or inject him with the serum. At the end of the mission, 47 flees into the wild. Meanwhile,
                Diana assumes power as Constant and enacts a purge of Providence's members from leadership positions at major global corporations,
                dismantling Providence's power structure. One year later, 47 reconnects with Diana and the pair return to their former roles as assassin and handler,
                respectively, to keep the global elites in check, albeit now working freelance.
                <p></p>
                In an alternate ending, if 47 injects himself with the serum while confronting Edwards, he passes out and later awakens in a padded room,
                greeted by Edwards's voice saying: "Wake up. Wake up, my friend.
                It's the dawn of a new day, and you have things to do", echoing the opening of Hitman: Codename 47.
                <p></p>
                <p><strong>Final considerations:</strong></p>
                Rich, rewarding, and highly replayable, Hitman 3 is a superb instalment of IO's idiosyncratic but much-loved stealth series.
                The fundamentals haven't changed since 2016 but its collection of outstanding maps makes for a refined, reliable,
                and robust curtain-closer to the current Hitman trilogy.
                Six maps may sound slim but each one is huge and designed to be played several times over –
                and even then it's very unlikely you'll have uncovered all of its creative and surprising assassination opportunities.
                There really isn't a weak one in the bunch.
                This barcoded butcher has made a lot of appearances over the past 20 years, but Hitman 3 is definitely one of his best.

            <div class="Review">
                <p><strong>Plot:</strong></p>
                Resident Evil Village is set three years after the events of Resident Evil 7, largely on the day of February 9, 2021.
                Ethan Winters returns as the protagonist, having defeated bioweapon Eveline in Resident Evil 7.
                Ethan has been living with his wife Mia and six-month-old daughter Rosemary when Chris Redfield—the protagonist of previous
                Resident Evil entries—and his men suddenly appear, murder his wife in cold blood, and kidnap him and his baby daughter.
                While Ethan and Rosemary are being transported in a van, a mysterious entity crashes it just outside the village.
                Ethan has to traverse the village to rescue Rosemary.
                The village is invaded by werewolf-like mutants called Lycans and governed by four different mutant lords,
                each controlling their own forces from strongholds within the village. Lady Alcina Dimitrescu, an unusually tall vampiric aristocrat,
                resides at Castle Dimitrescu with her three daughters Bela, Cassandra, and Daniela, and mutated female attendants.
                The hallucination-inducing and ghost-like Donna Beneviento rules from her mansion,
                House Beneviento, and acts through her puppet Angie.
                The grotesque Salvatore Moreau operates from a reservoir in close proximity to the village and is described as a "merman".
                Karl Heisenberg, who can manipulate electromagnetic fields, leads a group of Soldat simulacra from a contemporary factory.
                All houses respond to a supreme leader figure called Mother Miranda, the witch-like ruler of the village who is a "presence worshipped by the villagers."
                <p></p>
                <p><strong>Final considerations:</strong></p>
                Roaming the streets of Resident Evil Village is like visiting a disturbing and deadly Disneyland, where every attraction is a house of horrors.
                We got just as big a thrill out of revelling in its frenzied violence as we did retracing our steps through the gradually revealed recesses of
                its sizable village setting to uncover the darkest story secrets of its monstrous main cast.
                Boss fights are a bit of a letdown but the great variety of enemies throughout keeps things tense, especially on Hardcore mode.
                The fact that it's very much a throwback to the fast-paced action of Resident Evil 4 also means it largely takes a step back from
                the slow-burn scares of Resident Evil 7's excellent opening hours, which may well disappoint those who prefer more psychological dread to blowing off heads.
                But if you have an itch for action-heavy survival-horror, then Resident Evil Village will scratch it like a fistfull of Lady Dimitrescu's freakish fingernails.

                <p><strong>Plot:</strong></p>
                Far Cry 6 takes place in 2021 in Yara, a fictional Caribbean island nation inspired by Cuba and ruled by the dictator
                Antón Castillo (Giancarlo Esposito). A 1967 guerrilla revolution that toppled the presidency of his father led to Yara's isolation from the rest of the world.
                Since then, the country's economy has approached the brink of collapse. In 2014, Antón is elected president and oversees the creation of Viviro,
                a new cancer treatment developed from Yara's tobacco, promising it will make the economy stable.
                Seven years after being elected, Antón announces a draft "lottery" to conscript citizens as farmers in the tobacco fields.
                Antón has a 13-year-old son, Diego (Anthony Gonzalez), whom he grooms to be his successor.

                In the capital Esperanza, as Yara's armed forces round up citizens for the draft, Dani prepares to escape to Miami in the United States via fishing boat,
                alongside friends Lita Torres and Alejo Ruiz. Alejo is shot and killed after provoking troops in the street,
                while Dani and Lita flee to the awaiting boat filled with other refugees and escape. However,
                Antón stops the boat and reveals that Diego was attempting to flee with them. After retrieving Diego, he orders the boat sunk by gunfire.
                Dani survives the commotion and wakes up with a mortally wounded Lita on an island's beach, far away from Esperanza. As Lita dies,
                she urges Dani to look for the nearby Clara Garcia, leader of the guerilla movement Libertad. Upon arrival,
                Clara tells Dani to invite ex-spymaster and weapon maker Juan Cortez back into Libertad, disrupt the Fuerzas Nacionales de Defensa
                (FND) forces on the island, and clear the blockade trapping the guerrillas in the region. Once Dani fulfills all the tasks,
                Clara gives Dani a boat to flee Yara. If Dani does not leave, Clara gives the order to aid anti-Castillo forces throughout Yara's three major regions—Madrugada,
                Valle de Oro, and El Este—and convince them to help Libertad oust Antón.

                <p><strong>Final considerations:</strong></p>
                Far Cry 6 is some of the most fun we've had with this series in nearly a decade.
                Its cast delivers strong performances across an enjoyable story, even if it's also a fairly predictable one that doesn't
                always land the bigger swings it tries to take. And despite some faltering new inventory mechanics and a handful of bizarre design choices,
                its creative weaponry means taking down an outpost, ransacking a convoy, or even just taking a ride with a buddy has never felt better.
